A “tort” is any wrongful act or infringement of rights that will place legal liability with the offending party. A business tort, or economic tort, focuses on wrongful acts an individual or entity commits against businesses. These wrongful acts may be intentional or due to negligence, carelessness, or recklessness. Business torts typically cause some form of financial loss to the victim. They are not criminal offenses, although some cases may lead to criminal charges in addition to civil lawsuits.

Someone else’s wrongdoing can mean the downfall of an entire company. Business torts often involve damages to a company such as financial harm, loss of reputation, lost business opportunities, or the inability to remain in business. They are essentially an unlawful or negligent act that interferes with a business’s ability to operate as it otherwise would. The list of what qualifies as a “business tort” is long and flexible, but may include:

- Breach of contract
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Breach of trust
- Civil conspiracy
- Commercial disparagement
- Fraud and conversion
- Fraudulent misrepresentation
- Racketeering
- Restraint of trade
- Theft of trade secrets
- Trade libel
- Unfair competition
- Whistleblowing and retaliation
