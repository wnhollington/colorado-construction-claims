Colorado requires most construction professionals to obtain appropriate licenses in order to do business in the state. With that said, there is not a uniform state scheme. Given this, there can be considerable confusion as to what hoops a contractor or construction professional must jump through to obtain the appropriate approval to proceed with work. This article addresses general concerns and licensing requirements for construction professionals.

## Licensing Philosophy

A “license” is “a right given by some competent authority to do an act, which, without such authority would be illegal…”[^1] Like most states, Colorado requires certain construction professionals to obtain appropriate licenses prior to commencing work. In general, licensing requirements are promulgated to “protect the life, health, and property of the general public.”[^2] In short, licensing requirements ensure that construction professionals meet a certain threshold level of skill and experience to perform the task at hand.

## Licensing Authorities

Unlike some states that have a comprehensive statutory licensing scheme for both design professionals and contractors, Colorado does not. Depending on the type of construction professional, licenses are handled at either the state or local level.

### State Level

By statute, certain construction professionals must obtain appropriate licenses in order to conduct business within the state. In addition to the statutes that govern licensure, administrative boards are authorized by those statutes to promulgate rules and regulations governing licensure and to discipline licensed individuals. The following state boards have been established to carry out the statutorily prescribed duties:

- [State Board of Licensure for Architects, Professional Engineers, and Professional Land Surveyor](https://dpo.colorado.gov/AES);
- [State Electrical Board](https://dpo.colorado.gov/Electrical);
- [Examining Board of Plumbers](https://dpo.colorado.gov/Plumbing);
- [State Board of Landscape Architects](https://dpo.colorado.gov/LandscapeArchitects);
- [State Board of Examiners of Water Well Construction](https://dwr.colorado.gov/public-information/boards-and-commissions) ;
- [Air Quality Control Commission (Asbestos Abatement)](https://cdphe.colorado.gov/indoor-air-quality/asbestos);

At the state level, the licensing boards are the only entities empowered to issue licenses.[^3] The boards have discretionary power when considering an application for licensing, and their decisions will not be disturbed unless they are arbitrary and capricious.[^4] However, the boards’ power and discretion is not unfettered with respect to discipline, as they cannot create offenses not already set forth in the licensing statutes.[^5]

### Local Level

While licensing of design professionals such as engineers and architects is done at the state level, licensing of contractors (excluding plumbers, electricians, and asbestos abatement designers) is done at the local level. This decentralization creates significant difficulty for a general contractors desiring to do business in a particular jurisdiction in Colorado, and great care must be exercised so as to comply with the requirements of the local licensing authority. Indeed, many counties and municipalities do not accept or reciprocate contractor licenses and/or certificates from other counties or states.[^6]

### Considerations for Foreign Entities

For foreign entities and organizations seeking to do business in Colorado, equally important is compliance with other applicable statutes. If a company neglects to comply with other statutory requirements, it may be subject to possible sanctions as well as the inability to resort to the legal process. For instance, a foreign entity cannot transact business in Colorado without first obtaining a certificate of authority from the secretary of state.[^7] Failure to obtain such a certificate may preclude a foreign entity from suing anyone in Colorado and also subjects it to a possible civil penalty.[^8]

## Penalties for Failing to Obtain a Required License

The consequences of failing to obtain a license can be severe and can result in the denial of any entitlement to compensation, regardless of whether the services provided were properly performed.[^9]
Administrative Penalties: The consequences of failing to comply with statutory licensing requirements typically range from letters of admonition to license revocation.

### Voided Contracts and Right to Payment

Aside from administrative penalties that may be imposed, in the event that a license is required but not obtained, any contract entered into is generally void and unenforceable.[^10] As such, the unlicensed individual is not entitled to compensation to the extent the services rendered required a license. [^11]

### Deceptive Trade Practices

Moreover, the failure to obtain a necessary license may also subject a construction professions who represented that he or she was licensed to civil liability under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.[^12] Any person found to have engaged in a deceptive trade practice in violation of the CCPA shall be liable for the claimant’s costs in the action, including reasonable attorney fees, and may be subject to an award of treble damages.[^13] In addition, violation of the CCPA can result in criminal penalties imposed through the [Colorado Attorney General's Office](https://coag.gov/office-sections/consumer-protection).

## Conclusion

The lack of uniform state scheme with respect to licensure requirements can create considerable confusion depending on the type of construction professional you are. Given the significant penalties that can accrue for the failure to obtain appropriate licenses, it is critical to ensure that you obtain any necessary licenses prior to commencing work.
