Absent a contractual provision to the contrary, an owner’s failure to pay a contractor does not excuse the contractor from paying its subcontractors.[^1] Given this, many construction contracts contain provisions that attempt to condition a subcontractor’s right to receive payment on the contractor’s receipt of payment from the owner. An all-too-common dispute between contractors and subcontractors is the extent to which such a provision will be construed to allow a contractor to potentially avoid payment to subcontractors entirely. Pay-when-paid (“PWP”) and pay-if-paid (“PIP”) clauses are conditional-payment provisions intended to shift the risk of loss related to non-payment from the contractor down to their subcontractors.

## Pay When Paid

PWP clauses establish an appropriate timeframe for a contractor to make payment to their subcontractors. The underlying theory of such clauses is to increase the protection for contractors by timing their payment to subcontractors based upon their receipt of payment from the owner. Generally, such provisions with have “triggers” dictating when payment is to be made. If there is no explicit timing provision, then courts will generally find that payment must be made within a “reasonable time”.

## Pay If Paid

PIP clauses, on the other hand, conditions the subcontractors’ right to receive payment upon the receipt of the contractor’s payment from the owner. Importantly, if the contractor never receives payment from the owner, then its obligation to pay its subcontractors never arises. PIP clauses are generally viewed as extremely inequitable and are, accordingly, highly disfavored. This is generally because the entities that are harmed the most (the subcontractors) are generally the ones who will likely suffer the greatest. Because courts generally disfavor such a clause, a court will interpret such a clause - when it can - as creating only a PWP obligation to avoid an unjust result for the subcontractor. Given the inequitable result of PIP clauses, jurisdictions vary greatly when determining whether they are enforceable or not. Some jurisdictions invalidate these freely negotiated contractual terms through statute or common law. Conversely, many jurisdictions will uphold these clauses as valid contractual terms as long as they are explicit.

## Colorado's Stance on PIP Clauses

Colorado follows the latter line of cases. In 1999, the Colorado Supreme Court declared that PIP clauses are valid so long as the relevant contract terms unequivocally and clearly state that payment by the owner to the contractor is a “condition precedent” to the contractor’s obligation to pay the subcontractor and that the subcontractor bears the risk of the owner’s non-payment to the contractor.[^2]

## Carefully Drafting PIP Clauses

Considering the Main Electric decision, a contractor who intends to include a PIP clause in any other its subcontracts should be particularly careful as to how the language is worded. They should include specific language that payment by the owner to the contractor is a “condition precedent” to the contractor’s obligation to pay its subcontractors. Additionally, this provision should state that the parties understand and agree that the subcontractor bears the risk of the owner’s non-payment, and that the contractor is relieved of any duty to pay its subcontractors for the owner’s non-payment.
Without such specific language, a court will interpret an intended PIP clause to be a PWP clause. In the event that the owner does not pay the contractor, the contractor would be permitted to delay payment to its subcontractors, but only for a “reasonable period of time”. Eventually, the contractor would be required to make payment to its subcontractors for the work performed.
